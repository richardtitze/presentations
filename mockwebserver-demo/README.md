A simple comparison of building the same test with Wiremock and MockWebserver

You can find more info about Wiremock here: http://wiremock.org/
And about MockWebserver here: https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver

I did not use any of the extensions, which might make test setup simpler
